This readme provides an overview of the HTML file contained in this repository.

Overview
The HTML file is a web page that contains content and markup code. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a language used to create web pages and it allows developers to structure content and define how it should be displayed in a browser.

Usage
To view the web page in a browser, open the HTML file using a text editor and copy the code into a new file. Save the new file with an .html extension and open it in a browser of your choice.

Alternatively, you can upload the HTML file to a web server and view it in a browser by navigating to the URL of the file.

Contents
The HTML file contains the following elements:

doctype declaration: defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
html: the root element of an HTML page that contains all other elements.
head: contains metadata and links to external resources used by the web page.
title: specifies the title of the web page displayed in the browser's title bar.
body: contains the visible content of the web page.
headings: used to structure content and indicate its importance.
paragraphs: used to group text together and create new lines.
links: used to create clickable links to other web pages or resources.
images: used to display images on the web page.
lists: used to group related items together.
tables: used to display data in a structured format.
forms: used to collect user input.
Customization
To customize the HTML file, you can modify the content and markup code to suit your needs. You can also add additional elements and styles to create a unique web page.
