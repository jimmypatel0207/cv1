HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is used to create and design web pages. It is a fundamental building block of the web and is used to structure content, add media, and apply styling to web pages. This Readme file aims to provide a basic understanding of HTML and how to create an HTML file.

Getting Started
To create an HTML file, you will need a text editor. There are many text editors available for free, including Sublime Text, Notepad++, and Atom. Once you have a text editor, you can create a new file and save it with the .html file extension.

HTML Structure
An HTML document is structured using a series of tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and provide information about the content inside them. The basic structure of an HTML document is as follows:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p>Paragraph text</p>
  </body>
</html>
Let's break this structure down:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
<html>: The html tag marks the beginning and end of the HTML document.
<head>: The head tag contains metadata about the document, including the title of the page.
<title>: The title tag specifies the title of the page, which appears in the browser's title bar.
<body>: The body tag contains the visible content of the page.
<h1>: The h1 tag specifies a top-level heading.
<p>: The p tag specifies a paragraph of text.
